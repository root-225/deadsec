For full details on image management, see the [**Image Guide**](./docs/IMAGE_GUIDE.md).

### Image Guidelines

For optimal performance and user experience, follow these guidelines when adding images:

1. **Image Formats**:
   - Use `.jpg` for photographs
   - Use `.png` for images requiring transparency
   - Use `.svg` for icons and logos
   - Use `.webp` for better compression (with jpg fallbacks)

2. **Image Sizing**:
   - Hero/Banner images: 1920√ó1080px (16:9 ratio)
   - Service cards: 600√ó400px
   - Team/testimonial photos: 400√ó400px (1:1 ratio)
   - Blog thumbnails: 800√ó450px

3. **Optimization**:
   - Compress all images before adding to the project
   - Target file sizes: Large images < 200KB, thumbnails < 50KB
   - Use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) for compression

### Adding Images to the Project

1. Place your images in the appropriate subdirectory of `/public/images/`:
   - `/public/images/services/` - Service-related images
   - `/public/images/team/` - Team member photos
   - `/public/images/blog/` - Blog post images
   - `/public/images/general/` - General website images

2. Use Next.js Image component for optimal loading:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/images/services/cloud-service.jpg"
  alt="Cloud Services"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
```

3. For background images in CSS:

```jsx
<div 
  className="bg-cover bg-center h-96" 
  style={{ backgroundImage: 'url(/images/general/background.jpg)' }}
/>
```

### Using Image Utilities

The project includes powerful image utilities to help you manage and optimize images:

1. **Single Image Download and Optimization**:
```bash
node src/scripts/downloadImage.js https://example.com/image.jpg public/images/services/cloud-service.jpg --width=600 --height=400
```

2. **Batch Image Processing**:
```bash
npm run prepare-images
```
